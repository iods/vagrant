Vagrant - CONTRIBUTING
======================

I am always looking to improve my work with features and updates. Please take a second to review
this document in order to make the contribution and reporting process as simple as possible
for any and all developers who may be involved.

Following the below guidelines will help communicate that you respect the time of development 
and managing this project. That being said, it is important that the favor be returned and your
time be respected by addressing the issue and assessing any ideas or code improvements that are submitted.


Submitting and Tracking Issues w/ Issue Tracker
-----------------------------------------------

For my personal development, the Github Issue tracker is the preferred channel for reporting 
incidents, feature requests and submitting pull requests (currently not available). When submitting 
a request please consider the following:

* Please **do not** use the issue tracker for personal support requests (use the wiki for referencing
  past problems or adding new solutions).

* Please **do not** derail, thrash or troll issues. Keep the discussion on topic and
  respect the opinions of others.


Incidents & Defects (Bugs)
--------------------------

A **defect** is something stopping the artifact (feature, service) from completing it's intended
purpose. In Github's Issue tracker, these are reported through the use of incidents (one-to-many defects). A defect
can come in two forms - implementation and requirement. An implementation defect is described as one that
does not conform to the initial specs. A requirement defect is when the specs do not produce the
expected outcome. These are classified like this because one is quantitative and the
other qualitative which ultimately helps decide what and when gets fixed.

Descriptive and up-to-date incident reports are extremely helpful and can greatly decrease the amount
of resources spent on correcting an issue for a future release. Thank you in advance!

Guidelines for Reporting Incidents:

1. **Start with an Issue search** &mdash; check if the issue has already been reported and is in the queue.

2. **Check if the ticket has been fixed** &mdash; try reproducing the issue while collecting notes and
   screenshots so if anyone comes across it again they are aware of how to fix it.

3. **Isolate the Incident** &mdash; create a reduced test case and live example so I can
   spend more time on the solution rather than identifying the problem.

Informative incident reports won't leave me needing to chase you down for more information. Please
be as detailed as possible and provide as much information as possible in the ticket. Here are some
ideas of what to include in your submission:

* What is your environment?
* What steps have you taken to reproduce the issue?
* What browser/OS are you viewing the page in?
* What is the expected outcome?

Providing these details in the incident report will help myself and any other contributors fix any potential defects.

Example:

> Short and descriptive title of the incident you're experiencing.
>
> A brief summary of the problem and the browser/OS and environment in which it occurs. If
> suitable, include the steps required to reproduce the incident.
>
> 1. This is the first step I took and X happened
> 2. This is the second step I took and Y happened
>
> `<url>` - a link to the reduced test case or the live page the incident occurred on.
>
> Share any other information or variables that are relevant to the incident being
> reported. If possible, include the lines of code that you have identified as
> causing the incident, and any possible solutions to fix the defect.


Requesting a Feature or Improvement
-----------------------------------

You are welcome to and I appreciate any suggestions for improvement; however, please take a moment
to identify whether your idea is inline with the scope of this project. It's up to **you**
to make a strong case for considering implementation. Please provide as much detail and context as 
possible to limit the chances of your great ideas being turned down and time being wasted.


Pull Requests
-------------

Currently I am not allowing or supporting pull requests outside of my own team members; however,
for the sake of documentation I will discuss the benefits of pull requests and how they can
act as a valuable resource when working with distributed teams or implementing QA standards
in a development workflow.

Although it really is just a glorified code review a pull request is a wonderful tool to both learn
and educate. They are a fantastic help and a great way for teams to establish best
practices and guidelines for code submission and application development. On the other hand,
they need to remain focused and in the scope of the project and should be limited in unrelated
commits. They should also be done in a way that developers are never threatened or intimidated
because of how they have chosen to develop something. Always approach pull requests with care.

To limit the possibility of wasting time and resources, in the future **please ask first** with
any project before beginning a significant pull request (e.g. implementing new features, code
refactoring, api updates). Sometimes, I am hesitant to merge requests into projects
that are not first accepted through an initial discovery or by submitting a Issue ticket for approval.

If in the future projects allow for pull requests outside the normal workflow,
please **MAKE SURE** to adhere to the coding conventions and guidelines (coming soon) used
throughout a project and any other standards required for collaboration on
application sources.
