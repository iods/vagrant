Vagrant - @TODO
===============

This document outlines the proposed changes and additions that need to be made to
the Vagrant project for a v0.1.0 release.


Release v0.1.0 ~ Initial Development
------------------------------------

v0.1.0's purpose is to include past Vagrant files used in projects into a clean, organized repository. Doing this is
for no other reason than to clean up project environments, have a default configuration to build from with services like 
Docker, Puppet, Ansible, etc., and to re-organize the project into my own system for project/release management.

##### Estimated Release Date: N/A

The following is a list of features and fixes that are expected to be implemented in v0.1.0

### Platform (Tools & SDK's)

 * [ ] @TODO Add files from past Vagrant projects into repository
 
### General (Client & UI)
